# Why you should write

The best thing you can do is teach people to write. between that and thinking.<br/>
Blows me away about universities, is that no one ever tells students why they should write something!<br/>
It's like "well, you should have to do this assignment."<br/>
It's like "No, you need to learn to THINK."<br/>
If you can think, and speak, and write, you are absolutely deadly. Nothing can get in your way.<br/>
So that's why you learn to write.<br/>
