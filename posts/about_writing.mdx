# Why you should write

The best thing you can do is teach people to write. between that and thinking.
blows me away about universities, is that no one ever tells students why they should write something!
It's like "well, you should have to do this assignment."
It's like "No, you need to learn to THINK."
If you can think, and speak, and write, you are absolutely deadly. Nothing can get in your way.
So that's why you learn to write.
